# Project 7 - Task App

Submitted by: Stacey Annan

This app is a simple task manager that lets users create, edit, and delete tasks, each with a title, note, and due date. It uses a tab bar for navigation between a task list and a calendar view, and stores tasks locally on the device.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays a list of tasks
- [X] Users can add tasks to the list
- [X] Session persists when application is closed and relaunched (tasks dont get deleted when closing app) 
  - [X] Note: You have to quit the app, not minimize it, in order to see the persistence.
- [X] Tasks can be deleted
- [X] Users have a calendar view via navigation controller that displays tasks	


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Tasks can be toggled completed
- [ ] User can edit tasks by tapping on the task in the feed view
- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

One challenge I faced was setting up the tab bar controller correctly to connect multiple view controllers without breaking the appâ€™s navigation flow. I also had to troubleshoot a black screen issue, which was caused by not setting the tab bar controller as the initial view controller.
